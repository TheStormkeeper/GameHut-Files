# GameHut Files
Github repository for GameHut's "Learn To Code!" YouTube series which deals with coding for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis console, gathered here for ease of acquisition. The code itself is in 68k Assembly.

These files are owned (and were initially released by) Jon Burton (GameHut), and I'm just uploading them here so it's easier for people to download the files in one go without having to get all the files separately from Dropbox! I will try to keep this repository up to date where possible, as and when new file and video releases in the series are made available.

I also list the associated videos in relation to each of the files below, as well as providing a link to the associated video in the associated folder.

Please also note that these files require a copy of ASM68k, available <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/File:ASM68k.7z">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.7-zip.org">7zip</a> to open the ASM68k.7z file. Lastly, you also either need a Flash Cart to play on an actual Mega Drive/Genesis, or you can use an emulator to run the compiled code. You can get information and comparisons for emulators for various systems via <a href="http://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Sega_Genesis_emulators">Emulation General wiki</a>, <a href="https://segaretro.org/Comparison_of_Sega_Mega_Drive_emulators">SEGARetro</a>, <a href="http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/genesis/">Emulator Zone</a>, and various other sites by searching for "Sega Mega Drive (or Genesis) emulator".

Note that although ASM68k is a Windows (DOS?) executable, you can also run the BAT files in Linux via WINE and it will compile perfectly, and whilst I haven't tested it as of yet, I'm assuming that you should be able to run the BAT files using Dosbox. I have no idea what the situation is for MacOS devices, as I do not have one myself.

For further support with regards to these files, you can join the GameHut Discord here, and then go to the channel "<em>genesis-code</em>".
