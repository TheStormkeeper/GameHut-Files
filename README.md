Gamehut Files
Github repository for GameHut's "Learn To Code!" YouTube series which deals with coding for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis console, gathered here for ease of acquisition.

These files are owned (and initially released by) Jon Burton, and I'm just uploading them here so it's easier for people to download the files in one go without having to get all the files separately from Dropbox! I will try to keep this repository up to date where possible, as and when new file and video releases in the series are made available.

I also list the associated videos in relation to each of the files below, as well as providing a link to the associated video in the associated folder.

Please also note that these files require a copy of ASM68k, available <a href="http://info.sonicretro.org/File:ASM68k.7z">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.7-zip.org">7zip</a> to open the ASM68k.7z file. 

For further support with regards to these files, you can join the GameHut Discord here, and then go to the channel "genesis-code".
